# Amy's Immersive VAnilla ModPack

> Amy's take on a modpack that improves vanilla Minecraft with immersive visuals, soundscape, and worldgen while also improving player experience through many quality of life changes and performance optimizations.

There are no added blocks or changes to game mechanics. This is still vanilla just more immersive! Many settings have already been tweaked so this modpack should be playable right after install without any messing about.

* Uses [Amy's Optimized Vanilla Modpack](https://modrinth.com/modpack/amys-optimized-vanilla) as a solid base and builds from there. 

* Many improvements to the user interface and experience including dark mode everywhere, a recipe viewer, extra tooltips, camera tools, inventory tweaks, and much much more. 

* Special attention was paid to making the vanilla game without shaders look as amazing as possible with new textures, animations, particle effects and icons. 

* [Complimentary Shaders](https://modrinth.com/shader/complementary-reimagined) are enabled by default with settings tweaked to provide uncompromised visuals, or alternatively you can use the included MakeUp UltraFast shaders if your hardware is struggling and you still want shaders. 

* The soundscape was made more immersive with added sounds and all sounds now have directionality and physics. 

* Last, but not at all least the world generation has been drastically improved with incredible terrain generation paired with improved vanilla structures and plenty of new structures to find while out exploring.

Many, many, many mods, resource packs, and datapacks have been included so please take a look at the Credits.txt file for all the credit to the amazing people who made all the things. All I did was put them together, test they worked well with each other, and provided a few configuration files.
