Building on [Amy's Enhanced Vanilla ModPack](https://modrinth.com/modpack/amys-enhanced-vanilla) This is the continuation and pinnacle of her efforts to create a fun vanilla plus modpack that includes all the things she wanted from a modpack but couldn't find anywhere else. 

This is her modpack that finally adds new content to Minecraft. Some highlights are:

  * Create Mod for all the technical tinkerers
  * ZsoltMolnarrr's RPG series for the role players
    * Archers
    * Jewelry
    * Priests & Paladins
    * Wizards
  * Farmer's Delight for more diverse food options
  * Several world gen, mob, and game mechanics additions for the explorers
  * New blocks, ways to transform old blocks, and QoL improvements for builders

Many, many, many mods, resource packs, and datapacks have been included so please take a look at the Credits.txt file for all the credit to the amazing people who made all the things. This modpack was the first where I really had to learn about modding and how to integrate mods together that had conflicts or just weren't originally designed with other mods in mind. It's a labor of love and if you have any feedback or can help improve it, I'd greatly appreciate hearing from you.
