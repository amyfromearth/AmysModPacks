# Amy's Optimized Vanilla ModPack

> Amy's take on a purely performance and optimization modpack. I have included recommended settings as well as my preferred key bindings. 

Many optimized modpacks also include functional changes or additions to vanilla Minecraft and in my opinion feel more like vanilla plus than pure vanilla. My personal vision for optimized vanilla is strictly vanilla with mods that increase gameplay performance allowing the game to be played on a wide range of hardware. This modpack can provide a solid core modpack to build on if functional changes or additions to vanilla are wanted. 

Having a bunch of optimization mods installed can really improve performance, but going into the settings and making changes is where the most benefit can be seen. I've gone through and made some "best practice" settings changes that have proven to provide good gameplay performance by a wide range of players on varied hardware so you don't have to go through each setting option yourself. This modpack should be playable and have noticeable performance increases out of the box!

How many times have you thrown your sword instead of attacking in a moment of panic? In my personal opinion some of the default keybinds are less than great so I've included my own: 
* Sprint [Left Ctrl] --> [R] (r for run!)
* Drop Item [Q] --> [Y] (y for yeet, also it's out of the way enough you only throw your items if you mean to!)
* Toggle Perspective [F5] --> [Left Ctrl] (Much easier to reach and use)

Finally this pack does not attempt to provide OptiFine parity or the ability to use shaders. This is purely an Optimized Vanilla modpack. While I do love shaders this pack is strictly vanilla.

* Absolute vanilla gameplay -- No functional changes or additions to gameplay whatsoever.
* Pre-configured optimization settings -- settings following some of the most widely given advice are already done for you! 
* Default keybinds changed to prevent you from yeeting your items and move more used functions to be more easily accessed. 
* No OptiFine parity or shaders -- as pure vanilla as you can get while still being fully optimized. 

This is my first modpack and honestly all of the hard work was done by the various people and teams who wrote the mods; Please take a look at Credits.txt for all the credit to the amazing people who made all the things. My contribution is limited to changing some settings and testing to make sure all these mods work well together.
