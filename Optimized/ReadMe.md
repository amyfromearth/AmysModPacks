# Amy's Optimized Vanilla ModPack

> Amy's take on a purely performance and optimization modpack. Many highly recommended settings have already been changed for a hassle free install and play experience.

Having a bunch of optimization mods installed can really improve performance, but going into the settings and making changes is where the most benefit can be seen. I've gone through and made some "best practice" settings changes that have proven to provide good gameplay performance by a wide range of players on varied hardware so you don't have to go through each setting option yourself. This modpack should be playable and have noticeable performance increases out of the box!

Many optimized modpacks also include functional changes or additions to vanilla Minecraft and in my opinion feel more like vanilla plus than pure vanilla. My personal vision for optimized vanilla is strictly vanilla with mods that increase gameplay performance allowing the game to be played on a wide range of hardware. This modpack provides the core for [Amy's Immersive Modpack](https://modrinth.com/modpack/amys-immersive-modpack) but can easily be played stand alone for a fully vanilla experience.

Finally this pack does not attempt to provide OptiFine parity or the ability to use shaders. This is purely an Optimized Vanilla modpack. While I do love shaders this pack is **strictly** for performance optimazation of vanilla.

* Absolute vanilla gameplay -- No functional changes or additions to gameplay whatsoever.
* Pre-configured optimization settings -- settings following some of the most widely given advice are already done for you! 
* No OptiFine parity or shaders -- as pure vanilla as you can get while still being fully optimized. 

This is my first modpack and honestly all of the hard work was done by the various people and teams who wrote the mods; Please take a look at *Credits.txt* for all the credit to the amazing people who made all the things. My contribution is limited to changing some settings and testing to make sure all these mods work well together.
